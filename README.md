# Anti-Fraud-System

## About

In the Internet, you can often find sites where you need to answer some questions. It can be educational sites, sites with psychological tests, job search services, or just entertaining sites like web quests. The common thing for them is the ability to answer questions (or quizzes) and then see some results. In this project, it was developed with a multi-users web service for creating and solving quizzes.

## Description

Frauds carry significant financial costs and risks for all stakeholders. So, the presence of an anti-fraud system is a necessity for any serious e-commerce platform.

Let's implement a simple anti-fraud system consisting of one rule â€” heuristics. In the beginning, there's one simple measure that prevents fraudsters from illegally transferring money from an account. Suppose some scammers acquired access to confidential financial information through phishing or pharming. They immediately try to transfer as much as possible. Most of the time, the account holder is not aware of the attack. The anti-fraud system should prevent it before it is too late.
