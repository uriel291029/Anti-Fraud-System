# Anti-Fraud-System

## About

This project demonstrates (in a simplified form) the principles of anti-fraud systems in the financial sector. For this project, we will work on a system with an expanded role model, a set of REST endpoints responsible for interacting with users, and an internal transaction validation logic based on a set of heuristic rules.

## Description

Frauds carry significant financial costs and risks for all stakeholders. So, the presence of an anti-fraud system is a necessity for any serious e-commerce platform.

Let's implement a simple anti-fraud system consisting of one rule â€” heuristics. In the beginning, there's one simple measure that prevents fraudsters from illegally transferring money from an account. Suppose some scammers acquired access to confidential financial information through phishing or pharming. They immediately try to transfer as much as possible. Most of the time, the account holder is not aware of the attack. The anti-fraud system should prevent it before it is too late.
